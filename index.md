## Summary 

MTC Australia empowers over 20,000 vulnerable individuals each year, providing them with the skills, confidence, and opportunities to transform their lives through vocational education and employment services. I play a crucial role in this mission by architecting and delivering the technology solutions that underpin these vital services.

 

My current focus is building a robust and scalable Salesforce ecosystem that streamlines our service delivery. I'm passionate about creating solutions that are not only efficient but also user-friendly and accessible for everyone we serve. This involves collaborating closely with stakeholders to understand their needs, designing intuitive interfaces, and ensuring seamless integration with other essential systems. I'm equally committed to empowering our internal teams with the tools and workflows they need to maximize their impact. By optimizing our technology infrastructure, I aim to help MTC Australia extend its reach and create even more life-changing opportunities for the individuals we support
